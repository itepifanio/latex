Permutações são arranjamentos ordenados de objetos.

De quantas formas diferentes 4 letras A, B, C, D podem ser escritas 
PROBLEM 2.1 In how many different orders can the four letters
A, B, C, D be written, no letter being repeated in anyone
arrangement?
This is the same as asking how many permutations there are on
four letters, taken four at a time. The number of such permutations
is denoted by the symbol P(4, 4).
